Phase 1: Removing confirmed unused files...
Phase 2: Checking for empty directories...
Phase 3: Reviewing deployment configuration directories...
Keeping .vercel directory as it's still in use
Phase 4: Checking for potential duplicate files...
Found multiple worker files:
- src/worker.js (Main worker for handling static assets and routing)
- src/ai-worker.js (Specialized AI worker for processing AI requests)
- src/service-worker.ts (Browser service worker for PWA functionality)
These worker files serve different purposes and are likely not duplicates:
1. worker.js - Edge worker for routing and static assets
2. ai-worker.js - Specialized AI processing worker
3. service-worker.ts - Browser service worker for PWA features
Phase 5: Reviewing test/debug components...
Backing up and removing src/components/SupabaseAuthTest.tsx
Backing up and removing src/pages/AuthDemo.tsx
