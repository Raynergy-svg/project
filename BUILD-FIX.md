# Build Error Resolution

This document describes the dependency conflicts that were resolved to fix the build process.

## Fixed Issues

1. **TypeScript Compatibility**: Fixed version conflict between TypeScript 5.8.2 and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin 8.25.0
   - Solution: Downgraded TypeScript to ~5.7.3 and ESLint plugin to ^6.21.0

2. **React Version Compatibility**: Fixed version conflicts with React and React-DOM
   - Solution: Set specific versions (18.2.0) for React and React-DOM
   - Added resolutions field in package.json to enforce consistent versions

3. **PostCSS Configuration**: Fixed ESM compatibility issues with PostCSS
   - Solution: Changed configuration from CommonJS (.cjs) to ESM (.mjs) format

4. **Missing Dependencies**: Added missing date-fns package

5. **ESLint Configuration**: Fixed ESLint compatibility issues
   - Solution: Downgraded ESLint and related plugins to compatible versions

## CI/CD Updates

- Added `.npmrc` configuration for consistent dependency resolution
- Created a dedicated CI build script with force flag (`build:ci`)
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated building
- Created Netlify configuration for deployment

## For Dependency Updates in Future

When updating dependencies, maintain compatibility between:

1. React, React DOM, and types
2. TypeScript and @typescript-eslint
3. ESLint and its plugins

For major version upgrades, consider updating the entire stack rather than individual packages.

## Build Command

Use the following command for production builds:

```bash
npm run build:ci
```
